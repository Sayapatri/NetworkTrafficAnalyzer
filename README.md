# Network Traffic Analyzer Tool

The Network Traffic Analyzer Tool is a Python-based utility that captures and analyzes network traffic. It provides insights into packet-level data, helping users monitor network behavior, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues. This README provides an overview of the tool, its features, installation instructions, and usage examples..

## Features

- **Packet Capture:** Capture network packets from a specified network interface.
- **Packet Analysis:** Analyze captured packets for various attributes, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payloads.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize network traffic statistics using graphical plots and charts.
- **Filtering:** Apply filters to focus on specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, DNS, ICMP).
- **Logging:** Store captured data and analysis results in log files for later reference.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python (version 3.x) installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/kapilz007/NetworkTrafficAnalyzer.git


3. Navigate to the project directory:

 cd NetworkTrafficAnalyzer


4. Install the required Python packages:

  pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

- To capture and analyze network packets, run the `analyzer.py` script:


Follow the prompts to specify capture settings, filtering options, and the number of packets to capture.

- To visualize network traffic statistics, run the `visualizer.py` script:



Modify the example data in the script with your actual packet counts and protocol names.
